    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Empanadas are crescent-shaped, savory pastries made of dough and filled with a variety of ingredients. Empanada filling varies greatly, and can include anything from beef, chicken, pork, tuna, shellfish, cheese, and / or vegetables, seasoned vibrantly, then baked or fried to perfection.</p>
    <p>Empanada ingredients really run the gamut from country to country—in Puerto Rico you might have one with sofrito-laced ground beef, whereas in Mexico your empanada might be filled with shredded chicken and corn.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>ingredients</h4>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb. ground beef (20% fat)</li>
        <li>2 medium onions chopped</li>
        <li>2 small red bell peppers</li>
        <li>3 packages (12 each) Puff Pastry Dough for Turnovers/Empanadas</li>
        <li>½ cup pitted green olives (Picholine or Spanish), rinsed well, cut in half lengthwise, divided</li>
    
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook 2 lb. ground beef, breaking up with a spoon, until browned but not completely cooked through, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving as much fat in pan as possible.</li>
        <li>cook 2 medium onions, chopped, 2 small red bell peppers, seeded, chopped, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, stirring, until tender but not browned, 6–8 minutes; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Let 3 packages Puff Pastry Dough for Empanadas sit at room temperature 15 minutes to temper. Remove 6 rounds from package, keeping plastic divider underneath, and arrange on a work surface. Place 2 Tbsp. filling in the center of each round.</li>
        <li>Top with 2 olive halves. Brush water around half of outer edge of each round. </li>
        <li>Using plastic divider to help you, fold round over filling and pinch edges to seal. </li>
        <li>Using a fork, crimp edges. Remove plastic and transfer empanada to a parchment-lined sheet tray, spacing 1" apart. Repeat with remaining rounds (you’ll get about 12 empanadas on each tray)</li>
        <li>Bake empanadas, rotating tray halfway through, until golden brown and slightly darker around the edges, 25–35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
